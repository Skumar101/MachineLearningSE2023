# MachineLearningSE2023
Repository of the semester 2 Machine Learning project in Mr. Hayes's Software Engineering class. This group includes Nihal Kaki, Jagan Palanikumar, Ben Wang, and Sahil Kumar

Sprint #1:
Tasks Accomplished - Hardware ordered, Machine Learning code snippets and understanding, control of the camera and taking pictures at intervals while recording the information of the pictures, started 3D modeling the box to hold our hardware and dataset of goose and field images.

For next sprint (Sprint #2):
Model our machine learning algorithmn, finish creating and print our 3D model of the box holding our hardware, and have the machine learning algorithm and hardware communicate in order to see if a geese is on the camera at a time.
